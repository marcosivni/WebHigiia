# WebHigiia (WIA) - Client Project Sandbox 


**This repository contains the source code to reproduce the CBIR implementation reported in the manuscript _Enhancing COVID-19 and ILD diagnoses with Content-based Image Retrieval: An experimental study_. The [HC-CXRay-INT dataset](https://github.com/marcosivni/WiaChestExtractor) discussed in the manuscript is available [here](https://github.com/marcosivni/WiaChestExtractor).**

**WARNING: WebHigiia is NOT clinical software. It was designed for education and demonstration purposes ONLY!**


## _A CBMIR tool for X-Ray, CT and MRI images_

WebHigiia (WIA) is a Content-Based Medical Image Retrieval (CBMIR) tool designed for querying RX, CT and MRI images. WebHigiia is coded in C++ with Qt SDK (5.15.1 - LGPL-license), and it is compatible with Web Assembly (Emscripten coupled to Qt 5.15.1 with em++ compiler v2.0.22).

It supports JPEG, PNG, BMP, KRL, and DICOM medical images through self-contained 3rd-party libraries. The search mechanism is provided by a server counterpart that supports extended SQL queries (see [The Siren Project][siren]). Additionally, an external file server application is used for managing medical image storage (see [Websocketfy Project for WebHigiia](https://github.com/marcosivni/websocketfy)).

The implementation of WebHigiia follows a simplified Modelâ€“Viewâ€“Controller software pattern, where a set of pre-defined tables and classes are employed for accessing and querying medical image datasets stored in external servers. Figure 1 summarizes the relationships between the WebHigiia client and data servers.

The following steps are required to set your first WebHigiia CBMIR application up:

1. Configure a SIREN Server and run the DDL creation of its internal tables.
> The SIREN server can be downloaded from [its GitHub entry][siren] and compiled with Qt 5.15.1 basic modules (+ network and SQL). Please note SIREN is **neither** compatible with em++ (Web Assembly) **nor** loaded with its internal tables by default. Please, mind running the Siren DDL (creation) script after installation.

2. Run the [WebHigiia DDL script][higiiaddl] on the server-side.
> You can use a simple telnet connection (*i.e.*, `telnet <siren-server-ip> <siren-server-port>`) to submit the DDL script that contains standard SQL commands for the creation of the WebHigiia model tables.

3. Structure your medical image dataset as an *WebHigiia table*. Then, create it on the server-side.
> Please, refer to the [WebHigiia Modelling Guide][model] to structure your medical dataset as an WebHigiia table. The modeling process also generates a table where the query images will be inserted.

4. Load your **data** in the new dataset table and the **query images** (potentially undiagnosed cases) in the query table.
> Data are inserted with simple extended INSERT INTO commands. See the [example for mammograms][model]. Notice, feature extraction can be carried out manually or with the support of your favorite programming language and framework, e.g., sklearn, pandas, etc.

5. Run WebHigiia.
> You can either straightforwardly run the WebHigiia.html file alongside .wasm and .js loaders or compile the source code with Qt to generate a binary version of WebHigiia. 

6. âœ¨Query (undiagnosed) images by contentâœ¨

## A handful of new features

- Run either the desktop or the web version of WebHigiia alike
- Support for DICOM images
- Query images by content with either similarity or diversified similarity criteria
- Support for zooming and windowing operations
- Keep relevant and discard non-relevant results
- Support for relevance-feedback cycles
- Explore the entire search space from the query image viewpoint
- Distance-based labeling of query images

## Background technologies and 3rd-party libraries

The WebHigiia client tool relies on a series of background technologies and 3rd-party libraries, namely:

1. Background technologies 
    - [Qt SDK][qt] - Qt Cross-Platform and SDK C++ development environment. In addition module CHARTS must be downloaded (sudo apt-get install libqt5charts5-dev on Debian-based distros).
    - [Emscripten][ems] - The Open Source Emscripten compiler toolchain (from C++) to WebAssembly. Supported (in certain way) by Qt for WebAssembly.

2.  3rd-party libraries (self-contained)
    - [Hermes][hermes] - Our own C++ library of distance functions (and utils).
    - [Artemis][artemis] - Our own wrapper library for images (and utils).
    - [Dicomlib][dicomlib] - The classical self-contained Trevor Morgan dicomlib library from Google Code Archive (We were able to compile it with brand new Emscripten ðŸ˜€ - Classic codes die hard).
    - [Boost][boost] - A few (self-contained) Boost header files (without the need for compiling the entire library) - wasm-compliant.
    - [Eigen][eigen] - A few (self-contained) Eigen header files (without the need for compiling the entire library) - wasm-compliant.

## Limitations

Known limitations include:

- Absence of SSL authentication due to Web Assembly and QSsl conflicts (See [here](https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-76350)).

## Installation

Install the background technologies and download the source code of 3rd-party libraries.
Then, adjust the include paths of `webhigiia.pro.example` file to point to the installation folders of the 3rd-party libraries and rename it to `webhigiia.pro`.
After that, you can use `build.sh` to compile the client version.
Notice, you can configure the building type of WebHigiia in the `build.sh` file itself by selecting the `qmake` binary of your QT setup (e.g., wasm\_32 (default) or gcc\_64).

```sh
#!/bin/sh
/Qt/5.15.1/wasm_32/bin/qmake   #for Web-Assembly building
#/Qt/5.15.1/gcc_64/bin/qmake   #for desktop-binary building
make
```

Then, run the following command.

```sh
cd webhigiia
./build.sh && make clean
```

The web version of WebHigiia requires the browser to support .wasm files loaded through .js (Chrome and Firefox currently support WebAssembly).
Binaries are available at the `/frontend` directory.

## Directory structure

The directory tree is structured as follows.

| Dir | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| root  | Main functionalities and util. |
| icons | Contains the .png icons of the application. |
| model | Includes DDL creation scripts and examples for modeling your own WebHigiia-based application. |
| controller | Contains the controller classes for the application. |
| GUI | Contains the form and source code of the application. |
| frontend | Contains a pre-compiled .wasm version of WebHigiia.  |
| 3rd-party  | Includes the entry points for 3rd-party libraries. |
